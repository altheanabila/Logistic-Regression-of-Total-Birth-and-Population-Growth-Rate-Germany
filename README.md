# Logistic-Regression-of-Total-Birth-and-Population-Growth-Rate-Germany
I try to find the correlation between total number of birth and the population growth rate in Germany. Using logistic regression in python, I assigned the population growth in binary variable as positive = 1 and negative = 0.

1. Assign df and extracting the data [data.excel](https://github.com/altheanabila/Logistic-Regression-of-Total-Birth-and-Population-Growth-Rate-Germany/blob/main/Logitreg.xlsx)

2. Assign x variable and y variable

3. Using logistic regression syntax for python

4. import stats model using this line `import statsmodels.api as sn`

5. Assign constant for X variable

6. Run the logit syntax. As we can see that correlation is positively correlated with p value stood below 5%

7. Visualize the data through scatter plot
